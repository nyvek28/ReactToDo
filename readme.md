React Boilerplate Code <3

Ok, to make this app work you'll need the following:

-Node.js(And of course npm)
  You can download it here https://nodejs.org/en/

-Webpack
  Once you've downloaded Node and it's working it's time to install Webpack globally by running in your terminal:

  npm install webpack -g
  

Now, once you've got your environment all ready follow the next steps to run the app:


-(In your terminal) Run: npm install

-Run: webpack -w

-Run: npm start

-In your favorite browser, go to localhost:3000

-You should see a message rendered to the screen, this means everything went right and you're ready to rock some React
